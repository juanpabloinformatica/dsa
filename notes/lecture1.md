Introduction to algo

## Prerequisites

- maths for computer science: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIq4CssPoO0&list=PLUl4u3cNGP60UlabZBeeqOuoLuj_KNphQ

## Algo

- Read website

## Course overview

- Efficient procedures : for large problems

- Scalability

- Clasic dsa

- Real implementations done in python

  - Theory
  - Practical

## Content

- 8 modules

  - each have a problem (algo thinking)

- Algo thinking
- Sortinng & trees -> simulating a network
- Hashing -> genome comparison
- Numerics -> RSA encryption
- Graphs -> rubiks's cube
- Shortest paths -> caltech -> MIT
- Dyn programming -> Image compression
<!-- - Advanced topics ->  -->

## Peek finder

### 1D

a - i are numbers
[a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i]
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

find a peek
peek -> b>=a && b >=c
peek -> i >= h
peek -> a >= b

## Decision

- I don't feel prepared yet to follow this course is for that reason
  That i will do the basics the math and dsa for the book reading in this moment.
