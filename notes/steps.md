# Description

- Basically I don't feel i have a good foundation
  in this field so what I am whilling to do is the following.

- Implement all the datastructures in c++/c/python

  - Dynamic Array [x]
  - Stack [X]
  - Queue [X]
  - Linked-list [x]
  - HashMap []
  - Trees
    - Bst
  - Graphs

- I think i will do those on python,
  the debugging will be good for checking the stack

- Once i implement every dsa

  - In c and them c++ in a oop approach

- I will jump to solve some problems
  - leetcode
  - Read this book
  - Following france website

- I will recheck linkedlist but this time everything recursive as I tried but
  Testing everything.

- Doing everything now by tdd approach, need to try new things and i think this is good for showing a good work.
- In the linkedList try to fix the remove function put all the cases in just one function keeping in mind when u are removing the head.
